This project is a minimal example of:

 * Converting data into `tfrecord` format.
 * Using the `tf.data` api.
 * Using a custom `model_fn` with the estimator api.
 * Training locally and on Google Cloud Platform.
 * Automatic hyperparamter tuning on Google Cloud Platform.
 * Saving the model and performing inference in the browser using `tensorflowjs`.
